\begin{abstract}
In this report, I compare the operation efficiency of A* algorithm with different heuristic functions, with and without Tie Breaker. It turns out that A* with diagonal heuristic functions gets the shortest path in a complex map at the cost of visiting 592 nodes and consuming 1.749ms, which is far better than other methods. When it comes to a empty map, A* with manhattan heuristic functions is the best. Adding tie breaker to the program will only slightly reduce the number of nodes visited, but it will greatly increase the running time.

%\section{INTRODUCTION}
%A* algorithm is a classical search-based path finding algorithm.

\section{Heuristic Function}
A heuristic function is an estimated distance from a node N(x,y,z) to the goal G(x,y,z), which can be added to the accumulated cost to estimate the length of the path going through N, and thus improve the efficiency of search. The following is three different types of heuristic function.
\subsection{Manhattan}

\begin{equation}
D_{M}=\sum_{i=1}^{3}{|N_i-G_i|}  \label{H1}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Euclidean}

\begin{equation}
D_{E}=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{3}{(N_i-G_i)^2}} \label{H2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Diagonal}
Let
\begin{equation*}
d_i=|N_i-G_i|, i=1,2,3.
\end{equation*}

Make sure that $ d_1 \leq d_2 \leq d_3 $, and
\begin{equation}
D_{D}=\sqrt{3}d_1+\sqrt{2}(d_2-d_1)+(d_3-d_2).   \label{H3}
\end{equation}

\section{Tie Breaker}
For the nodes with the same minimum f score in the open list, it is not necessary to visited all of them. So when there are more than a node with the same minimum f score, the program will compare their h score and choice the node with minimum h score to visit.

	\label{tbl:table1}
\end{table}

In order to generate the same experimental environment, I set the random seed as 1 when generating random map. What's more, I write a new node to publish a goal so that the searcher will receive the same goal. For each method, the program will run 10 times and then output the average of the results. I set the goal at (4.78851,3.76074,0.5) and create a complex map and an empty maps to test different methods.Fig \ref{fig:label4_1} and Fig \ref{fig:label4_2} shows the complex and empty maps. Table \ref {tbl:table1} shows the results of different methods. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figs/fig4_1.png}
	\caption{Complex map and a path from the start point to the goal point generated by the program}
	\label{fig:label4_1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figs/fig4_2.png}
	\caption{Empty map and a path from the start point to the goal point generated by the program}
	\label{fig:label4_2}
\end{figure}

From the first four lines of Table \ref {tbl:table1}, we can find that although A* Manhattan has the shortest running time, its path length is not optimal because Manhattan distance always longer than the realistic shortest path. Compared with A* Euclidean, A* Diagonal runs shorter times and visits less nodes as a result of that Diagonal distance is closer to the realistic shortest distance from the start point to the goal point than Euclidean distance. Namely, Diagonal distance is more accurate in estimating the realistic shortest path.

For the methods with Tie Breaker, it shows that the program runs longer time but visits a little fewer nodes. A* Manhattan with Tie Breaker obtains a better path than A* Manhattan.

For the map with less obstacles, it turns out that A* Manhattan finds the shortest path at at the cost of both least running time and visited nodes.


\section{Problems I meet}
\subsection{Problem I}
When I set the goal at the edge of the map, the system reports errors that Segmentation fault (Address not mapped to object [(nil)]) as it is showed in Fig. \ref{fig:label5_1}. Finally, I find that when the program get the neighbors, the feasible index ranges from 0 to GL\_SIZE-1 rather than 0 to GL\_SIZE.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figs/fig5_1.png}
	\caption{Errors: Segmentation fault (Address not mapped to object [(nil)])}
	\label{fig:label5_1}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Problem II}
When there are more than one node in the open list that has the same smallest f score, I create a multimap type container to store these nodes. Before the program push a node into the container, it should judge that if the iterator is equal to the last iterator of the open list first,  otherwise the program may overflow.

%\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
%Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
%separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
%formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
%proofreading, spelling and grammar.
%
%Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
%formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
%for you.
%
%\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
%Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
%even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
%IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
%abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.
%
%\subsection{Units}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
%\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
%\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
%\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsection{Equations}
%Number equations consecutively. To make your 
%equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
%appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
%but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
%sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
%sentence, as in:
%\begin{equation}
%a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
%\end{equation}
%
%Be sure that the 
%symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
%the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
%the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''
%
%\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}
%
%Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
%of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
%to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
%citations without having to go through the file line by line.
%
%Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
%\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
%environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.
%
%Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
%will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
%equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
%article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
%the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
%counting.
%
%{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
%data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
%bibliography you must send the .bib files. 
%
%{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
%subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
%referenced as Table IV-B3. 
%
%{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
%\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
%supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
%cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
%should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.
%
%Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
%will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
%any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
%surrounding equation.
%
%\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
%\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
%\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
%\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
%\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
%\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
%\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
%\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
%\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
%\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
%\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
%\end{itemize}
%An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.
%
%\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
%\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
%minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
%should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
%next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
%and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
%affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
%example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).
%
%\subsection{Identify the Headings}
%Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
%your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.
%
%Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
%topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
%References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
%``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
%table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
%style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
%down menu to differentiate the head from the text.
%
%Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
%example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
%material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
%sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
%and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
%should be introduced.
%
%\subsection{Figures and Tables}
%\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
%bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
%figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
%below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
%figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
%``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

%
%Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
%rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
%avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
%``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
%units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
%with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
%\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
%quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
%``Temperature/K''.
%
%\section*{Acknowledgment}
%
%The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
%an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
%G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
%acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
%
%\section*{References}
%
%Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
%sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
%number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
%the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''
%
%Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
%the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
%abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.
%
%Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
%``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
%submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
%that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
%Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
%element symbols.
%
%For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
%citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
